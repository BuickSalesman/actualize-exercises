# QUESTION 1
# Start your program with the line of code below.
# The rest of your program should create and print out 
# an array that removes all duplicates from the original array. 
# That is, the second array should look like: [4, 6, 1, 2, 8, 3, 7]
# The one catch: Don't use the "uniq" method available to arrays! (That would do this for you.)

numbers = [4, 6, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 4, 1, 7]

#nested loop to remove the 4th, 8th, and 9th numbers in the sequence??

# index = 0 
#     while index < numbers.length
#         puts numbers.[index]
#         index = index + 1
#     end

# --that didnt work

# numbers.each do |number|
#   puts number if
#     number 

# --no clue what im doing here

# index = 0
# while index < numbers.length
#   if numbers[index] = 4
#   index = index 
#   else
#   index = index + 1
#   end
# end

# --this is just half baked

# no idea how to even begin to break this down

#[4, 6, 1, 2, 8, 3, 7]
