My name is Adam O'Donnell. I have been removed from any sort of formal education since 2014, and I have always had a problem with that. I have kicked around the idea of returning to school ever since I dropped out of college, but was never interested enough in any field to fully commit to it. I like to consider myself a life-long-learner, but I also know how I learn, and have typically rejected formal academia. I am an exceedingly creative individual, with a fondness for rhythms and patterns. It is for this reason I am willing to take on learning coding as a skill and art form, so that I may one day be paid to express my ideas, and not be looked down upon for taking a ball and running with it. I look forward to getting to know each member of my cohort, and each member of staff, as the intricacies of human relationships are truly the spice of life.
