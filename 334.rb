# QUESTION 1
# Have the user enter 10 words, and allow for duplicate words. 
# After the user is done, the program will tell the user 
# which word was entered the most frequently.
# For example, if the user enters: 
#   apple, banana, orange, pear, apple, pear, apple, squash, apple, pear
# The program will say: "apple was your most common word"
# (That's because apple appeared in the user's list 4 times, more than any other word.)

#section where you have to enter all your words
#place where words are stored, sorted, and value assigned per word
#return response based on highest value

puts "put word"
w1 = gets.chomp.to_s
puts "put word"
w2 = gets.chomp.to_s

puts w1
puts w2

# puts "put word"
# w3 = gets.chomp.to_s
# puts "put word"
# w4 = gets.chomp.to_s
# puts "put word"
# w5 = gets.chomp.to_s
# puts "put word"
# w6 = gets.chomp.to_s
# puts "put word"
# w7 = gets.chomp.to_s
# puts "put word"
# w8 = gets.chomp.to_s
# puts "put word"
# w9 = gets.chomp.to_s
# puts "put word"
# w10 = gets.chomp.to_s
