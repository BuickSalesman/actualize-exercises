# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Make a hash to store a person's first name, last name, and email address. Then print each attribute on separate lines.

person = { "first_name" => "Kelsey", "last_name" => "Kavanagh", "email" => "kgpk1234@aol.com"}
pp person["first_name"]
pp person["last_name"]
pp person["email"]

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#took 3 attempts to solve from memory, will work on additional has/array
#problems tomorrow
