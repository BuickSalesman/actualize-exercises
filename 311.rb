# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.
#For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 26.

numbers = [7, 12, 21, 6]
sum = 0
index = 0
while index < numbers.length
  sum = sum + numbers[index]
  index = index + 1
end
p sum

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#took 4 attempts to write from memory, will continue work on arrays and hashes tomorrow
